🔧 Prerequisites

Before running any commands, set your API keys:

export YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key_here
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

🚀 Example Commands

# Extracts distilled insights from a YouTube video
fabric -y 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw' | fabric -p extract_wisdom

# Saves and uploads transcript
fabric -y 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw' | tee transcript.txt && cat transcript.txt | fabric -u

# Analyze claims from a GitHub repo
fabric -u https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/ -p analyze_claims

✅ The Good
    •   Feels philosophically aligned with UNIX: composable, pipe-friendly CLI tools.
    •   Promising groundwork for integrating LLMs into everyday workflows.
    •   Tools like code_helper show potential—though other projects (e.g., Cursor) currently lead on adoption.

❌ The Bad
    •   Some patterns veer from playful to risky, especially as abstractions over prompt engineering without constraints.
    •   LLM output reliability remains uneven—some patterns feel magical, others brittle.

🌱 The Promise
    •   Command-line composability feels right; lightweight integration is appealing.
    •   Tools like improve_prompt hint at the still-untapped affordances of LLMs.
    •   Happy someone else is tracking prompt evolution—don’t want to own that overhead.
    •   Would like to see more flavors/variants of “improve” tailored to intent (clarify, reframe, polish, etc).

🌀 The Weird
    •   Some system prompts (e.g., explain_math) are more esoteric than useful—but possibly worth exploring.

🌟 Notable Patterns

improve_prompt

Simple, general-purpose upgrade for unclear or underperforming prompts.
