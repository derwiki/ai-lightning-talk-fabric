Observations

The Good
	•	Very philosophically UNIX: acts as plumbing, usable in many contexts.
	•	CLI piping support is elegant and flexible.
	•	code_helper could be neat, though tools like Cursor currently have more momentum.

The Bad
	•	Some prompt patterns scale from silly to dangerous—similar to common risks in prompt engineering.

The Promise
	•	Command-line integration is compelling.
	•	Tools like improve_prompt make conceptual sense—even if LLM capabilities aren’t yet fully understood.
	•	Glad someone else is keeping track of all this complexity.
	•	Possible future: different “flavors” or variants of improve_prompt.

The Weird
	•	This one’s a bit odd but might be worth having:
	•	Explain Math Pattern
